# SuperCryptor
SuperCryptor is my final JAVA Project. Just like the name states, this is encryption software. SuperCryptor encrypts all kinds of files by manipulating bits and bytes. One of the main features is a decision algorithm that recommends the user the best encryption for his file.

### Encryptions
SuperCryptor is focused on bitwise encryption but a sophisticated one. Once key series is generated, the user chooses between few encryption types. Each encryption algorithm performs different bitwise operation according to behavior path that is determined by the key series.

* Path Encryption
* Knight's Tour
* Sudoku
* Shuffle Card
* Half XOR

### Key Generator
In order to generate secret encryption keys, I am using mathematical structures:
* Fibonacci series
* Pascal Triangle
* Hanoi Tower
* Knights tour
* Graph paths
* Sudoku Solver

### Auto Recommender
As mentioned above, SuperCryptor includes a recommender system - a decision tree that recommends the best key generator and encryption(s) for the user.
